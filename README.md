==================

PHP SDK for Volar's client sdk, Version 2 (pre-alpha)

This is a rework of the existing [PHP SDK](https://github.com/volarvideo/cms-client-sdk).  Primary purpose of the rework was to eliminate the step of uploading files directly to the volar servers - instead, when videos are archived or posters are uploaded, the files are uploaded to our remote storage and enqueued for transcode, relieving a lot of the work our servers have to do to bring content to viewers.

The downside is that the PHP sdk now has a new dependancy - the Amazon AWS SDK.  However, a composer.json file has been included in this repository, which should make things simpler.
